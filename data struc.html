<pre><h1 id="data">Data Structure</h1>
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data.
 More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data. 
Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.
Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. 
For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers. 
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. 
Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. 
Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.
<b>Linear Data Structures</b>
Data elements in a linear data structure are linked to one another in a sequential arrangement, with each element linked to the elements in front of and behind it. In this manner, a single run can traverse the structure. Linear data structures consist of four types. 
They are:
	1.Stack
	2.Array
	3.Queue
	4.Linked list
<b>Stack</b>
The linear data structure stores the data elements in the ‘first-in/ last-out’ or the ‘last-in/ first out’ order. 
These orders are known as FILO and LIFO orders, respectively. By using Stack, the element can be added and removed simultaneously from the same end. 
In Python, Stack can be developed in the following ways.
1.Queue.LifoQueue
2.List
3.Collections.deque
 In Stack, the terms ‘Push’ and ‘Pop’ are used instead of ‘insert’ and ‘delete’.
<b>Array</b>
It is the collection of similar data types that are stored in the Contiguous Memory Locations.
Arrays are used in Python as well. Arrays work on the scale of 0 to (n-1), where ‘n’ denotes the size of the array. 
Arrays are of two types. 
They are:
	One-dimensional Array
	Multi-dimensional Array
<b>Queue</b>
The queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO order.
FIFO stands for First In and First Out. The order is that the elements which are inserted first are to be removed first. 
The properties of Queue data structure are:
1.Inserting an element
2.Deleting the element
3.Time of access.
<b>Linked List</b>
Linked Lists separate the data structures that are stored consecutively.
The last node of a data structure will be linked to the first node of the next data structure. 
The first element of any data structure is known as the Head of the List. 
The linked list helps in memory allocation, stores data in internal structure etc.
There are three types of Linked Lists.
 They are:
1.Single Linked List
2.Double Linked List
3.Circular Linked List
<b>Queue</b>
The queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO order.
