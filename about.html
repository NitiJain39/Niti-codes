<br><h2>Web Designing :- </h2><br>
 <p style="font-size:18pt;">Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.<br> 
The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); <br>
authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; <br>

Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. <br><br>
Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. <br>
Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. <br>
It involves designing websites, mobile apps, and user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX). <br>
