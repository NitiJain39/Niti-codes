<h1> SKILLS Required for Web Designing :- </h1><br><br>
<h2>1.Knowledge of Basic (HTML , CSS) Languages :-</h2><br>
<p style="font-size:18pt;"><b>HyperText Markup Language</b> 
or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It defines the content and structure of web content.<br>
It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br>
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit : <br><br></h3>
                           <p style="padding-left:58px;font-size:18pt;">Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.<br>
                           However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).<br>
                           We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.<br>
                           Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.<br></p></p><br>
<p style="font-size:18pt;"><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b><br> 
CSS is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as<br> 
HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
This separation can improve content accessibility;<br>
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;<br> 
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,which reduces complexity and 
repetition in the structural content; <br>
and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br></p> <br>
