<pre><b>Java</b> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                 <h3>Example Programs :-</h3>
         <b> 1. To Print :- Hello World</b>
                 <code>
                 public class Main {
                 public static void main(String[] args) {
                 System.out.println("Hello World");
                 }
                 }
               </code>
        <b> 2. To Show :- If-Else </b>
               <code>
               public class Student {  
               public static void main(String[] args) {  
               int x = 10;  
               int y = 12;  
               if(x+y < 10) {  
               	System.out.println("x + y is less than      10");  
               }   
               else {  
               	System.out.println("x + y is greater than 20");  
               }  
               }  
               }
              </code>
       <b> Output:- </b> x + y is greater than 20
